## 1. Purpose
ISO 9001 specifies requirements for a **Quality Management System (QMS)**.

This document provides **operational guidance** for establishing, implementing, and maintaining a QMS aligned with DevOps, CI/CD, and enterprise operations. It is **practical and enterprise-focused**, not academic.

---

## 2. Scope
The scope covers:
- Operational processes in DevOps pipelines
- Software release management
- Change management
- Incident and problem management
- Process documentation and control

Out of scope:
- Organizational strategy beyond operational quality management
- Non-IT related processes

---

## 3. Core Principles
ISO 9001 principles applied here:
- **Customer Focus:** Internal stakeholders, product teams
- **Leadership:** Clear roles, responsibilities, accountability
- **Engagement of People:** Training, awareness, participation
- **Process Approach:** Standardized workflows, reproducibility
- **Improvement:** Continuous enhancement of processes
- **Evidence-based Decision Making:** Metrics, KPIs
- **Relationship Management:** Teams, third-party providers, tooling vendors

## 5. Process Approach
1. **Plan:** Define workflows, standards, and responsibilities
2. **Do:** Execute processes according to defined standards
3. **Check:** Monitor KPIs, audit processes, capture issues
4. **Act:** Corrective and preventive actions, process optimization

---

## 6. Documentation Control
All documents are controlled using:
- Versioning
- Author and owner identification
- Approval and review cycles
- Storage in version-controlled repository (Git or documentation system)

---

## 7. Performance Monitoring & Metrics
Example metrics for QMS in DevOps context:
- Mean Time to Deploy (MTTD)
- Change Failure Rate
- Incident Response Time
- Audit Findings & Closure Rate
- Process Compliance Rate

---

## 8. Continuous Improvement
- Review meetings after major releases
- Post-mortems after incidents
- Quarterly audits
- KPI tracking and reporting

---

## 9. Expected Outcomes
- Standardized and reproducible operational processes
- Predictable quality in DevOps pipelines
- Audit-ready documentation and processes
- Continuous improvement in operational efficiency
- Alignment with enterprise QMS standards
