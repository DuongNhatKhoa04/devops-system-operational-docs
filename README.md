## 1. Purpose
This repository serves as a **personal professional portfolio** documenting my
continuous self-development journey in **DevOps, system operations, security,
and quality management**, following **enterprise and ISO-aligned practices**.

The primary objective of this repository is to demonstrate:
- Structured thinking in system design and operations
- Enterprise-grade documentation practices
- Alignment with ISO 27001 and ISO 9001 principles
- Long-term technical leadership mindset (DevOps → Solution Architect → CTO)

This repository is intentionally maintained as **documentation-only**,
separate from any application source code.

## 2. Scope
The documentation in this repository focuses on:
- System and platform operational design
- DevOps workflows and CI/CD governance
- Security controls and operational security practices
- Quality management and process standardization
- Risk management, audit readiness, and compliance thinking
- Decision-making rationale behind technical choices

The scope emphasizes **how systems should be designed, operated, and governed**,
rather than how to implement specific application features.

## 3. Target Audience
This repository is designed for:
- DevOps and Platform Engineers
- Solution Architects
- Technical Leads
- Engineering Managers
- Security and Compliance reviewers
- Myself, as a long-term knowledge base and leadership reference

## 4. Repository Structure

The repository is organized following a **hierarchical structure**, reflecting how documentation is typically classified and governed in enterprise environments:

```
DevOps Operational Documentation

├── Overview
│   ├── System scope
│   ├── Terminology
│   └── High-level vision
│
├── Architecture
│   ├── Logical architecture
│   ├── Physical architecture
│   └── Deployment architecture
│
├── Standards
│   ├── ISO 27001 interpretation
│   ├── ISO 9001 interpretation
│   └── Internal standards

│   ├── Control mapping
│   └── Audit readiness
│
└── Appendices
    ├── Glossary
    ├── References
    ├── Diagrams
    └── Decision records (ADR)
```

This hierarchy represents a **top-down governance model**, moving from strategic context and architectural intent down to operational execution and compliance support. It mirrors how mature organizations structure documentation to support scalability, auditability, and long-term system ownership.

## 5. Documentation Philosophy
This repository follows these principles:
- **Separation of concerns:** Documentation, code, and infrastructure are isolated
- **Traceability:** Decisions and changes must be explainable and reviewable
- **Security-first mindset:** No sensitive data is stored in this repository
- **Process-driven thinking:** Emphasis on repeatability and consistency
- **Continuous improvement:** Documents evolve as understanding deepens

## 6. Standards and Best Practices Alignment
The documentation is conceptually aligned with:
- **ISO/IEC 27001** – Information Security Management System (ISMS)
- **ISO 9001** – Quality Management System (QMS)

The alignment focuses on **practical operational controls and governance**,
rather than formal certification requirements.

## 7. Governance and Change Management
- All documentation changes are version-controlled using Git
- Changes represent deliberate improvements in understanding or design
- Major changes should include rationale and impact considerations
- This repository is treated as a living system, not static documentation

## 8. Relationship to Other Repositories
This documentation repository is designed to complement, not replace:
- Application source code repositories
- Infrastructure-as-Code repositories
- CI/CD configuration repositories

Links to related repositories may be added as the portfolio evolves.

## 9. Long-Term Vision
This repository is part of a long-term professional roadmap:
- **Short term:** Strengthen DevOps and operational excellence
- **Mid term:** Develop Solution Architecture and system-level thinking
- **Long term:** Build technical leadership and CTO-level governance perspective

The focus is not on tools alone, but on **decision-making, risk management,
and sustainable system design**.

## 10. Disclaimer
This repository represents personal research, experimentation, and learning.
It does not claim formal ISO certification or represent any organization.
